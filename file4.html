    <h1>Teaching & Academic Mentorship</h1>

    <!-- Deep Learning TA -->
    <h2>Teaching Assistant — Deep Learning Lab</h2>
    <p><em>Under Dr. Pandyaraju V | July 2025 – Nov 2025</em></p>

    <p>
      Served as a Teaching Assistant for a master’s-level Deep Learning Lab while still
      an undergraduate, supporting a cohort of 60 second-year master’s students.
      This role involved grading assignments, preparing lecture materials, invigilating
      examinations, and providing conceptual clarity during lab sessions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Assisted students in understanding and implementing core deep learning concepts,
      including neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), GANs, LSTMs,
      and regularization techniques. Teaching these topics significantly strengthened
      my own conceptual foundations and highlighted the depth of preparation required
      to deliver effective instruction.

    <!-- Software Engineering TA -->
    <h2>Teaching Assistant — Software Engineering</h2>
    <p><em>Under Dr. Rama Prabha K. P. | Aug 2024 – Dec 2024</em></p>

    <p>
      Supported the delivery of a core Software Engineering course for 60 undergraduate
      students by assisting with theory sessions, grading assignments, and mentoring
      student teams through their project development lifecycle.
    </p>

    <p>
      Guided students on principles of software design, version control, code
      maintainability, documentation practices, and testing methodologies. Through
      close mentorship, student teams demonstrated improved project planning,
      clearer documentation, and more maintainable codebases, leading to stronger
      overall project outcomes.

    <!-- Teaching Philosophy -->
    <h2>Teaching Philosophy & Impact</h2>
    <p>
      Across both roles, I observed tangible improvements in code quality, experimental
      rigor, and student confidence. These experiences reinforced my belief in mentorship
      as a collaborative learning process—where teaching deepens understanding and
      structured guidance empowers students to build with clarity and confidence.
