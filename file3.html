    <h2>Voice-Assisted Embedded AI System</h2>
    <p>HFT-X is a high-frequency trading engine featuring a custom UDP market data feed capable of streaming 100K+ msgs/sec into a real-time order book and matching engine. The system achieves sub-1ms tick-to-trade latency (p99) using optimized in-memory data structures, non-blocking I/O, and microsecond-level event processing.

    <h2>Concept Drift Detection & Adaptive Retraining with XAI</h2>
    <p>Built a multi-head YOLOv8 model for joint obstacle detection and pavement segmentation, cutting latency by 33%.
        FastDepth on Jetson Nano for real-time monocular depth-8FPS,  context-aware audio navigation - visually impaired users.
        Achieved 85.2% mAP (obstacles) and 85.9% mAP (curb segmentation) | Patent application in progress.</p>

    <h2>HFT-X: High-Frequency Trading Engine</h2>
    <p>Designed a modular, async drift detection framework unifying statistical and ML-based detectors, reducing false drift alarms by 38% and improving true drift detection by 27% over single-method baselines.
        Optimized feature-level explainability by selectively executing SHAP only post-drift, cutting explanation latency by 61%</p>
